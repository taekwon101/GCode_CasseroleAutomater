Writes g-code file with automated looping and simplified inputs

CHANGELOG
1: more finely, faster, smaller
2: smaller-still, true origin start
3: chopped off cycle from 7 to 6 each way
4: cut step size 15->3 [repeat 6->30], upped speed so P could go 7->13 hopefully
5: developed python automation for writing loops and simplifying inputs

I recommend checking code changes with nraynaud's g-code simulator: https://nraynaud.github.io/webgcode/
